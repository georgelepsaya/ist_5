# Report on Datasets and Processing

## Housing Prices in Germany
**üè† Apartment rental offers in Germany** dataset from Kaggle: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/corrieaar/apartment-rental-offers-in-germany

The dataset contains rental offers scraped from Germany's biggest real estate online platform - 
Immoscout24. This dataset only contains offers for rental properties. While it was created from 2018 
to 2019, it is still relevant and gives a good idea of the housing situation in different parts of Germany. 

### Pre-processing
The strategy for preprocessing is the following:
1. If a variable contains a lot of missing values:
    - We remove it if it doesn't have much relevance for this analysis
    - We keep it to display if it is relevant at any point
    - There is no need to perform imputation and handle all missing values, since the goal is not to build a 
    model but to conduct a meaningful exploratory analysis of this dataset.
2. Remove irrelevant variables:
    - Some of the variables are out of the scope of this analysis
    - "Description" and "Facilities" columns have already been dropped to lower the size of the dataset
3. Remove duplicate variables
    - There are variables with a different name, which contains the same data in the same or worse format.
    These columns should be dropped.



## Airbnb rent prices in European cities
This analysis is based on several independent datasets that share the same structure. 

The datasets used are available here:
- https://zenodo.org/records/4446043

For this analysis, only data has been taken for workdays for Barcelona, Amsterdam, Berlin, and Budapest.

The columns are as following:

- `realSum`: the full price of accommodation for two people and two nights in EUR
- `room_type`: the type of the accommodation 
- `room_shared`: dummy variable for shared rooms
- `room_private`: dummy variable for private rooms
- `person_capacity`: the maximum number of guests 
- `host_is_superhost`: dummy variable for superhost status
- `multi`: dummy variable if the listing belongs to hosts with 2-4 offers
- `biz`: dummy variable if the listing belongs to hosts with more than 4 offers
- `cleanliness_rating`: cleanliness rating
- `guest_satisfaction_overall`: overall rating of the listing
- `bedrooms`: number of bedrooms (0 for studios)
- `dist`: distance from city centre in km
- `metro_dist`: distance from nearest metro station in km
- `attr_index`: attraction index of the listing location
- `attr_index_norm`: normalised attraction index (0-100)
- `rest_index`: restaurant index of the listing location
- `attr_index_norm`: normalised restaurant index (0-100)
- `lng`: longitude of the listing location
- `lat`: latitude of the listing location

## Pre-processing & Processing

The `preprocess_dataset` function is responsible for cleaning up the dataset by removing unnecessary columns. 

1. Column Removal: The function uses the DataFrame.drop method to remove the following columns from the dataset:

### Preprocessing in `visualize_dataset`
#### Room Type Filtering

The function allows users to filter the dataset by room_type using a dropdown (`st.selectbox`).
If a specific room type is selected (other than "All"), the dataset is filtered to include only rows where the room_type matches the selected value:
```python
if room_type_filter and room_type_filter != "All":
    df = df[df["room_type"] == room_type_filter]
```

#### Color Metric Calculation:

A new column, `color_metric`, is added to the dataset. 

This column is calculated based on the selected `color_metric_col` (e.g., `realSum` or `guest_satisfaction_overall`).
The color_metric column is created by applying a lambda function to scale the values of the selected column into RGBA color values:
```python
df["color_metric"] = df[color_metric_col].apply(
    lambda x: (
        int(255 / df[color_metric_col].max() * x),  # Red
        100,                                        # Green
        150,                                        # Blue
        255                                         # Transparency
    )
)
```

#### Renaming Columns for Mapping:
The dataset's longitude (lng) and latitude (lat) columns are renamed to lon and lat, respectively, to match the requirements of `st.map`:
```python
df.rename(columns={"lng": "lon", "lat": "lat"})
```
