    **üè† Apartment rental offers in Germany** dataset from Kaggle: 
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/corrieaar/apartment-rental-offers-in-germany

    The dataset contains rental offers scraped from Germany's biggest real estate online platform - 
    Immoscout24. This dataset only contains offers for rental properties. While it was created from 2018 
    to 2019, it is still relevant and gives a good idea of the housing situation in different parts of Germany.

    The strategy for preprocessing is the following:

    1. If a variable contains a lot of missing values:
        - We remove it if it doesn't have much relevance for this analysis
        - We keep it to display if it is relevant at any point
        - There is no need to perform imputation and handle all missing values, since the goal is not to build a 
        model but to conduct a meaningful exploratory analysis of this dataset.
    2. Remove irrelevant variables:
        - Some of the variables are out of the scope of this analysis
        - "Description" and "Facilities" columns have already been dropped to lower the size of the dataset
    3. Remove duplicate variables
        - There are variables with a different name, which contains the same data in the same or worse format.
        These columns should be dropped.
